1. Game starts with game charactor(sprite henceforth) on the base.
2. User will press anywhere on the screen to define length of path. Shorter press = smaller path, longer press = longer path
3. As the sprite moves to the subsequent block, score is increased.
4. Goal is to move to the next block by creating paths of adequate length
5. Once transition to the next block is successful, block with sprite will move to the left edge of the screen
6. The frame will seem to go forward exposing more blocks on the right 
7. When user presses for path creation, path is created vertically upwards.
8. Once user stops pressing, the path then rotates 90degrees clockwise centered along the bottom corner
9.Once the path is laid horizontally, character moves along the path.
10. If the path is such that its end does not fall within the display width of the next block, character dies
